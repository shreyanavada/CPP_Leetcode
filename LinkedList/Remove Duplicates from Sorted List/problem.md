Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 

Example 1:


<img width="302" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/423e039f-c357-45fd-a619-63e3591acf89" />

Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]


Example 2:


<img width="542" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e75a3d-dcbc-4728-b10e-833a4cae3fcf" />

Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
