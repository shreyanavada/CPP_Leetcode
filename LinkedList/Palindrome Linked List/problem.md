Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

<img width="422" height="62" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc42cb66-ffb6-4603-82c6-8976789ad952" />


Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

<img width="182" height="62" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5be22ccb-7f65-4ee0-9dbb-2f59cfca2849" />


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
 

Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
