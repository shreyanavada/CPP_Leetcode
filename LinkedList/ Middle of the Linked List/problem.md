Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

<img width="544" height="65" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b1c895-4046-4d56-9cb9-a7bab4f155a6" />


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5] Output: [3,4,5] Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:


<img width="664" height="65" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ca05401-9c92-42f9-a01a-fef66b9d18ed" />


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6] Output: [4,5,6] Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100]. 1 <= Node.val <= 100
